A program for running JavaScript without the web browser. Use this to experience pure* JavaScript. 

* Not actually 100% pure, as JavaScript does not come with any input/output of any kind (100% pure JavaScript is therefore unusable), so print() and println() functions were added to provide output capability.

This program was built in NetBeans. You should be able to build it by running the following commands:  
$ cd Path/To/PureJS  
$ ant jar
